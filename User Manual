Program for The Toggery


This program is intended to speed up the process of gathering customer information, by allowing the customer to directly
enter their personal information, opposed to waiting in line to speak with an employee.This program will gather
information from the customer, it will validate that all required fields are filled and that the phone number is
a 10-digit number. After successfully inputting all information, a new window will display a contract that must be
accepted to continue, if not accepted then the program will print the user information with a disclaimer of "Canceled".
After the user has agreed to the term and conditions of the contract, a thank-you box will show confirming that their
items have been accepted and are awaiting inspection by employee. The program will print and save the customers
information for later use by an employee.

*note*
With more practise and skill I would like this same program to automatically send a SMS message or even an email to
the customer when their items have been processed by an employee.

The Toggery has a database management company that I would need to contact to further the functionality of this
program, such as linking to the database to search for existing customers.
