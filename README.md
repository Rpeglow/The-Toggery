fields are filled and that the phone number is a 10-digit number. After successfully inputting all information, a
new window will display a contract that must be accepted to continue, if not accepted then the program will print the
user info with a disclaimer of "Canceled". After the user has agreed to the term and conditions of the contract,
a thank-you box will show confirming that their items have been accepted and are awaiting inspection by employee.
